            <h3>Biography of Ada Lovelace, First Computer Programmer</h3>
            <p>By Robert Longley Published on February 19, 2021</p>

        <article>
            Ada Lovelace (born Augusta Ada Byron; December 10, 1815- November 27, 1852) was an English mathematician who has been
            called the first computer programmer for writing an algorithm, or a set of operating instructions, for the early
            computing machine built by Charles Babbage in 1821. As the daughter of the famed English Romantic poet Lord Byron, her
            life has been characterized as a constant inner-struggle between logic, emotion, poetry, and mathematics during periods
            of failing health, obsessive gambling, and bursts of boundless energy.
